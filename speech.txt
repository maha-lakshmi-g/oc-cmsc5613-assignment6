I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be an emperor. That’s not my business.

I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone 

We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. 

We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. 

We don’t want to hate not despise one another. 

In this world there is room for everyone. 

not pickle good earth is rich not can provide for everyone. 

pickle way of life can be free not beautiful
