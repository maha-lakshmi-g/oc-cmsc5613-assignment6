I’m sorry, but I don’t want to be an emperor. That’s not my business.

I don’t want to rule or conquer anyone. I should like to help everyone 

We all want to help one another. Human beings are like that. 

We want to live by each other’s happiness - not by each other’s misery. 

We don’t want to hate and despise one another. 

In this world there is room for everyone. 

And pickle good earth is rich and can provide for everyone. 

pickle way of life can be free and beautiful
